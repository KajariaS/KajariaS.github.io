    "text": "I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural & Applied Economics at the University of Georgia, Athens, focusing on the economics of environmental resources. \nMy research examines how mangroves influence housing prices and community views in southwest Florida, highlighting households’ willingness to pay for mangroves through property values. I also investigate the resilience mangroves provide to property values during hurricane events. \nPrior to graduate school, I worked in the banking sector in India, managing risk reporting and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. I handled complex escalated customer cases, working directly with the Banking Ombudsman and regulatory authorities to resolve high-stakes issues.\nI am on the job market for the 2024-25 academic year.
